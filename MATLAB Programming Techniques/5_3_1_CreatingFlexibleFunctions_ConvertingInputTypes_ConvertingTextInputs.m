%% Run Your Function
% Calling with string input
% This works correctly.
v = volumeL(["1 gallon" "1 pint"])

% Calling with character vector input
% This currently gives the incorrect result, but you will fix it.
v = volumeL('1 gallon')

% Calling with cell array of character vectors input
% This currently errors, but you will fix it.
v = volumeL({'1 gallon' '1 pint'})
