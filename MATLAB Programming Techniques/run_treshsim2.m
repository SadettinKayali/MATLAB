%% Run Your Function
% Calling with four inputs
% This works correctly.
rng(123)
p = threshsim2(10,6,"uniform")

%% Calling with three inputs
% This currently gives the wrong result, but you will fix it in this activity.
rng(123)
p = threshsim2(10,6,"unif")

%% Further Practice
p = threshsim2(10,6,"Normal")
